ANLogoS is a very small and simple userscript that simply changes the color of the letter L in the AniList logo to match the theme of the currently viewed profile.

[This userscript has a website](https://animetopbtns.github.io/website/ANLogoS/)

**Known bugs:**
1. When first visiting a profile it may not properly change the color (current workaround: clicking anywhere on the page will change the color, after that it will change on that profile when the page is loaded) If you find a fix to this problem let me know either via [Email](mailto:alltheanimetopbtns@gmail.com?subject=Fix%20for%20ANLogoS%20problem%20with%20color%20changing) or on [the feedback page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/456970-anlogos-anilist-dynamic-colored-logos/feedback)
