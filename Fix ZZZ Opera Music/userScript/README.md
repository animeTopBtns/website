Fixes the music not playing in the Opera Browser on the [Zenless Zone Zero](https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/) websiteand adds a volume slider.

PLEASE NOTE: This is not meant to fix the song not auto playing, and instead fixes a problem that just prevents the song from playing at all (though it will make it auto play, if you install this to try and fix problems with auto play you will have the song play twice and overlap).
