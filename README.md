All the anime top buttons
=========================

All my anime top buttons put together into one userscript

This UserScript adds a button to many anime related websites. This button will take you back up to the top of the page. (or to the bottom if you hold shift)

This userscript has a website now: [https://animetopbtns.github.io/website/](https://animetopbtns.github.io/website/)

I have also made [this UserStyle](https://userstyles.world/style/10017/youtube-sticky-show-less-button) with a similar point, making things easier, this one however makes some buttons on YouTube sticky (This UserStyle is made and tested with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)).
